# Time Stamp Cleaner
This script was created to reformat any data file that leads with timestamp into just HH:MM:SS formatting. I created it because I had a large data points which included a timestamp followed by accelerometer and gyroscopic data. However, when I needed to isolate just the timestamps for analysis, I created this script to make that process much easier.
